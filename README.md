# ChargeMyRide
Project for Factor√≠a F5 bootcamp
App to show charging stations for electric vehicles in an interactive map populated by an API from the Catalan government available at:
https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/a09002970-estacions-de-recarrega-per-a-vehicle-electric-a-catalunya

Notes: 10 day sprint using Flask and Python for the first time
Less TDD than I would have liked
Individual project but with some help from some of my bootcamp fellow coders. Thanks to all of them!
